Tutorial for creating new respository

I just transferred as a Junior to the University of Florida this fall. I was accepted into their computer
science program, and I plan to graduate by the end of 2018. I'm also minoring in math, which was a choice
I made because my interests lie in computer graphics. I'm hoping git will be a useful tool with managing
my own projects, and helping me learn more with respect to the specilizations I'm interested in.
